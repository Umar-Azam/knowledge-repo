### Prompt structure to explore ideas from single line snippets. Building out models if possible

Take a deep breath and think about this step by step, go through this short text to analyze, understand and interpret the meaning behind it. then expand on any ideas that the text is connected to and provide a detailed explanation and knowledge expansion. The note is :  
"Insert Note here"

### Optional next prompt to build mathematical models. 

- Build out a detailed mathematical model for this interpretation, first formulate the idea conceptually and explain all the subcomponents of it, then start outlining the mathematical structure
- think step by step about what the functionality of this model is, then mathematically describe it in a detailed intuitive and well structured way


### Example usecase
Take a deep breath and think about this step by step, go through this short text to analyze, understand and interpret the meaning behind it. then expand on any ideas that the text is connected to and provide a detailed explanation and knowledge expansion. The note is :  
"AI Agent problem solving loop, A* algorithm for problem solving. Search through conceptual decision space using language and multi-modal AI models. Path search through decision space to solution"
